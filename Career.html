        <h1>Future Career</h1>
        <p><br> My dream job is to be come a systems analyst. Since high school I tend to be curious on what does it look like to work with computers and I really like poking around computers either it is a software or a hardware device. My mother works as a computer teacher and a robotics teacher and my father's work is systems analyst before. That is why I am motivated to work in the IT industry because of them. Earlier last year I already started to work my way into the bpo industry so that when the time comes and I graduate, I am already familiar on the work that I will be getting in to.   </br></p>
