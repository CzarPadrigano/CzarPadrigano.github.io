 		<h1>Family Background</h1>
 		<p class="description"><br> My family consists of 5 members, my father, my mother, me, and my 2 younger sister. My father is Eric Padrigano and he is 47 years old. He was an analyst on Accenture for 10 years but he recently resigned. My mother is Rosalie Padrigano and she is 47 years old also. She was a computer teacher before but when she gave birth to our youngest sibling she quit her job and she just recently started working again on a bpo company. And me, who is the eldest of the three is 19 years old currently a working student. Lastly, my two younger siblings named Precious Kaina and Courtney Brianne are both studying in elementary. Precious kaina is currently a grade 6 student and Courtney is currently a grade 1 student. I wanted to put a picture of us here but we don't have a family picture.  </br></p>
